**Hello there 👋!** 

My name is **Gerson Israel Diaz de la Garza**. I am currently in my ninth semester of **Systems Engineering** studies at the **Francisco de Paula Santander University** and I am a **Technician in Programming Applications and Services for the Cloud** from **SENA** (Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje).

I have a passion for programming, specifically **Frontend Web development** using the Angular Framework. I have engaged and been working in numerous projects using Angular, primarily for learning, practicing, and developing my skills in this path.

In my spare time, I delve into and learn about cloud development and implementation, with a particular interest in Azure. I am also exploring the creation and research of multi-agent systems through open-source LLMs. These are hobbies that I pursue for various personal projects. Additionally, I enjoy designing graphical interfaces and user experiences in Figma.

As a person, I am proactive, creative, and curious. I consider myself a fast learner in whatever is needed. As of today, I am fluent in English (B2 level) and Spanish (native), and I am currently learning French.
